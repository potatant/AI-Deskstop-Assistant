#AI-Deskstop-Assistant#
Speech is a natural and powerful way for humans to interact with machines. This project explores and implements an AI-based desktop assistant that enables users to interact with their system using speech or text commands, leveraging modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and speech recognition technologies.

--About the Project
The assistant utilizes automatic speech recognition (ASR) to understand voice commands and responds through either textual feedback or system actions. 
The aim is to create a seamless and accessible interface that can improve productivity, accessibility, and overall user experience.
The assistant is capable of: Controlling the desktop environment (e.g., opening apps, browsing) Accessing external services (e.g., search engines, weather APIs) Creating custom workflows using voice or typed input 

-- Technologies Used
Text-to-Speech (TTS) Natural Language Processing (NLP) Dialog Management Machine Learning & Deep Learning Microsoft SAPI (Speech API) for integration with Win 

-- Project Objective This project is designed to:
Deepen theoretical understanding of ASR and NLP Explore modern speech and language algorithms.
Build a functional assistant using APIs and open-source tools Demonstrate practical applications for desktop interaction via voice/text 

-- Future Scope
Add support for multilingual voice inputs
Improve NLP pipeline for better context understanding
Integrate with IoT devices and smart home applications
Enhance personalization using user behavior learning
the deepspeech files were too large to upload on git...so feel free to reach out for those.
